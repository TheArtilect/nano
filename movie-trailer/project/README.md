# Fresh
### By Ian Agpawa
##### This repo is for a movie trailer website of my favorite movies and shows.  The OMBDb API is utilized to the obtained movie and show info.    


### Quick Start
-Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/TheArtilect/movie-trailer.git`


You can run the app by either opening the `fresh.html` file with your browser or by executing `python movie_list.py` in the terminal while in the project directory.  Executing the python command will overwrite the `fresh.html` file if there are any changes made in either the `movie_list.py` file or `fresh.py` file.
