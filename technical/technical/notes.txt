Knapsack problem
-Optimization problem
A number of objects with different weights and values need to fit into a bag with a weight limit to maximize value.

Brute Force Solution
O(2^n) exponential time, not polynomial (i.e. O(3n))
n = number of objects

Faster solution
table of weights and values
O(nW)


Dynamic Programming
Problem: Max value for weight limit
Subproblem: Max value for some smaller weight

Base Case: Smallest computation (compute values for one object)

Value at weight limit = value of current object + value in table at (weight limit - current object)




Traveling salesman problem
Cities are nodes, roads are edges between them, what's the fastest way for salesman to travel to every city and return home?

NP-Hard no polynomial time
